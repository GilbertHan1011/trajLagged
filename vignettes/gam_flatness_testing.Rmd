# Introduction

This vignette describes comprehensive methods for testing whether a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) fitted with the `mgcv` package represents a "flat" (non-significant) relationship. In the context of single-cell trajectory analysis, determining whether gene expression changes significantly along pseudotime is crucial for identifying dynamic genes.

## What Does "Flat" Mean?

A "flat" GAM indicates that:
- The smooth term(s) do not significantly deviate from zero
- The relationship between predictor and response is essentially constant
- The GAM does not provide a better fit than a simple intercept-only model

# Available Testing Methods

The `trajLagged` package provides four complementary statistical tests for GAM flatness:

## Method 1: Summary-based Test (Approximate F-test)

This is the simplest and most commonly used method, extracting p-values directly from the GAM summary.

**Advantages:**
- Fast and straightforward
- Built into mgcv
- Well-established statistical theory

**Limitations:**
- May be less powerful for complex smooth terms
- Relies on asymptotic approximations

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Basic usage
gam_model <- gam(y ~ s(x), data = your_data)
result <- test_gam_flatness(gam_model, method = "summary")
```

## Method 2: Advanced Wald Test with Contrasts

This method manually constructs contrasts between predicted values at different points along the curve and tests whether these differences are significantly different from zero.

**Advantages:**
- More flexible and customizable
- Can test specific hypotheses about curve shape
- Provides detailed control over testing procedure

**Limitations:**
- More computationally intensive
- Requires careful handling of matrix operations
- May be sensitive to the number of contrast points

**Mathematical Foundation:**
The test constructs a contrast matrix L that compares predicted values at consecutive points:
- L β represents the differences between consecutive predictions
- The Wald statistic is: W = (Lβ)ᵀ (LVₚLᵀ)⁻¹ (Lβ)
- Under H₀ (flatness), W ~ χ²(df)

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Wald contrasts test with custom number of points
result <- test_gam_flatness(gam_model, method = "wald_contrasts", n_points = 100)
```

## Method 3: Likelihood Ratio Test

Compares the fitted GAM with a null model (intercept only) using likelihood ratio statistics.

**Advantages:**
- Theoretically well-founded
- Compares nested models directly
- Good power for detecting non-linearity

**Limitations:**
- Requires fitting additional models
- May be sensitive to model specification

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- LR = 2(log L(GAM) - log L(null))
- Under H₀, LR ~ χ²(df_difference)

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Likelihood ratio test
result <- test_gam_flatness(gam_model, method = "likelihood_ratio")
```

## Method 4: F-test for Smooth Terms

Extracts F-statistics specifically for smooth terms from the GAM summary.

**Advantages:**
- Focuses specifically on smooth terms
- Provides F-statistics in addition to p-values
- Good for models with multiple smooth terms

```{r eval=FALSE}
# F-test for smooth terms
result <- test_gam_flatness(gam_model, method = "f_test")
```

# Comprehensive Testing Strategy

For robust inference, we recommend using multiple methods:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Run all tests simultaneously
all_results <- test_gam_flatness(gam_model, method = "all")
print(all_results$overall_interpretation)
```

The overall interpretation considers the consensus across all methods:
- **Strong evidence for flatness**: All tests suggest flatness
- **Strong evidence against flatness**: All tests reject flatness
- **Mixed evidence**: Tests disagree, requiring careful interpretation

# Integration with trajLagged Pipeline

## Testing Individual Trajectories

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Test flatness for both reference and target trajectories
trajectory_results <- test_trajectory_flatness(
  sce1 = sce1_object,
  sce2 = sce2_object,
  gene = "GENE_NAME",
  test_both = TRUE,
  method = "all",
  alpha = 0.05
)

# Access results
ref_flat <- trajectory_results$reference$flatness_tests$overall_interpretation
target_flat <- trajectory_results$target$flatness_tests$overall_interpretation
```

## Batch Testing Multiple Genes

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Test multiple genes efficiently
gene_list <- c("GENE1", "GENE2", "GENE3")
batch_results <- lapply(gene_list, function(gene) {
  test_trajectory_flatness(sce1, sce2, gene, method = "summary")
})
names(batch_results) <- gene_list
```

# Visualization and Diagnostics

The package provides comprehensive diagnostic plots:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create diagnostic plots
plot_gam_flatness(
  gam_model, 
  flatness_results, 
  main_title = "GAM Flatness Diagnostics"
)
```

The diagnostic plot includes:
1. **GAM smooth with confidence intervals**: Visual assessment of flatness
2. **Residuals vs fitted**: Check model assumptions
3. **Q-Q plot**: Assess normality of residuals
4. **Test results summary**: Numerical results from all tests

# Practical Recommendations

## Choosing Significance Levels

- **α = 0.05**: Standard choice for most applications
- **α = 0.01**: More conservative, reduces false positives
- **α = 0.10**: More liberal, increases sensitivity

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Test with different significance levels
for (alpha in c(0.01, 0.05, 0.10)) {
  result <- test_gam_flatness(gam_model, alpha = alpha)
  cat("Alpha =", alpha, "- Is flat:", result$summary_test$is_flat, "\n")
}
```

## Method Selection Guidelines

- **For routine screening**: Use `method = "summary"` for speed
- **For publication-quality analysis**: Use `method = "all"` for robustness
- **For custom hypotheses**: Use `method = "wald_contrasts"` with specific contrasts
- **For model comparison**: Use `method = "likelihood_ratio"`

## Handling Edge Cases

1. **Very noisy data**: Consider increasing smoothing parameters
2. **Small sample sizes**: Use more conservative significance levels
3. **Multiple testing**: Apply appropriate corrections (e.g., Bonferroni, FDR)

# Example Workflow

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(trajLagged)

# 1. Load your data
# sce1 <- your_reference_data
# sce2 <- your_target_data

# 2. Test a single gene
gene_result <- test_trajectory_flatness(
  sce1, sce2, "YOUR_GENE",
  method = "all",
  alpha = 0.05
)

# 3. Examine results
print(gene_result$reference$flatness_tests$overall_interpretation)
print(gene_result$target$flatness_tests$overall_interpretation)

# 4. Create diagnostic plots
plot_gam_flatness(
  gene_result$reference$gam_model,
  gene_result$reference$flatness_tests,
  "Reference Trajectory"
)

# 5. Test multiple genes
gene_list <- c("GENE1", "GENE2", "GENE3")
batch_results <- lapply(gene_list, function(gene) {
  test_trajectory_flatness(sce1, sce2, gene, method = "summary")
})

# 6. Summarize results
flat_genes <- sapply(batch_results, function(x) {
  x$reference$flatness_tests$summary_test$is_flat
})
cat("Flat genes:", sum(flat_genes, na.rm = TRUE), "out of", length(gene_list))
```

# Statistical Considerations

## Multiple Testing Correction

When testing many genes, apply appropriate corrections:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Extract p-values
p_values <- sapply(batch_results, function(x) {
  x$reference$flatness_tests$summary_test$p_values
})

# Apply FDR correction
adjusted_p <- p.adjust(p_values, method = "fdr")
significant_genes <- names(adjusted_p)[adjusted_p < 0.05]
```

## Power Analysis

The power to detect non-flatness depends on:
- Sample size
- Effect size (magnitude of non-linearity)
- Noise level
- Smoothing parameters

## Model Assumptions

Ensure your GAM meets standard assumptions:
- Independence of observations
- Appropriate error distribution
- Adequate sample size for smooth estimation

# Conclusion

The GAM flatness testing framework in `trajLagged` provides robust, multi-method approaches for determining whether gene expression trajectories show significant temporal dynamics. By combining multiple statistical tests with comprehensive diagnostics, researchers can make well-informed decisions about which genes exhibit meaningful changes along developmental trajectories.
